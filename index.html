                    The canteen in my school provides students, teachers and other staff with delicious food and drink in hygienic condition. I know that instead of buying things from roadside sellers, it is safe to eat canteen food. Roadside food can spoil our health. I am lucky to have such a good canteen in my school.

Teachers and other staff members are served by canteen boys in trays. They are served with some light refreshments, tea, coffee, soft drinks, etc. They eat it in their office and staffroom during lunch and short breaks. Even they enjoy canteen food wholehearted.

Many find our school canteen as a great advantage to both pupils and staff. However, a few PTA members do not think so. They think that school encourages students to spend money on eating outside food.

Our Principal Mrs. Karbhari is a truthful and straightforward woman. She always likes to put good new ideas into practice. Last month one of the parents in a PTA meeting suggested that there were good chances of improving the services provided by the school canteen. Since then many positive changes have been brought to the canteen.

The quality of the food has improved. It is served fresh and clean. Food is tastier than ever before. Special utensils are used to store food. The variety of food has increased. Most importantly, it is available at many affordable rates.

                <p class=list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12>1. Accuracy
                  Studied the transfer of improvement in accuracy of numerical computation, to arithmetical reasoning. Pupils from 4 schools were taken for the study. The pupils were divided into 2 equal groups on the basis of preliminary tests in arithmetical reasoning. One group was practiced in working rule sums, while the other was engaged in history, drawing and similar subjects. After a number of days, both groups were tested in arithmetical reasoning. Though one school revealed no transfer effect, the other 3 schools showed that the practiced group improved in arithmetical reasoning. The results have been attributed to release of mental energy resulting from improved facility in computation, or to the association established between the 2 kinds of function. Suggestions for further research have been provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

                  2. Economics
                  Economics is a social science with stakes in many other fields, including political science, geography, mathematics, sociology, psychology, engineering, law, medicine and business. The central quest of economics is to determine the most logical and effective use of resources to meet private and social goals. Production and employment, investment and savings, health, money and the banking system, government policies on taxation and spending, international trade, industrial organization and regulation, urbanization, environmental issues and legal matters (such as the design and enforcement of property rights), are just a sampling of the concerns at the heart of the science of economics.

                  3. Productivity / Efficiency
                  You are a content writer and you write for a blog. You need to finish your blog post in five working days. On average, you can write 700 to 800 words a day (together with research, brainstorming, etc.).

Now, your manager tells you that you will need to finish your future blog posts within three working days. There has been some labor shortage in the company lately, and a decreased number of employees will have to achieve the same output. Therefore, you need to do the same work now but using fewer resources i.e. time.

You somehow manage to finish your blog post on time, but you worry that you didnâ€™t do enough research and answer the topic well.

Consequently, doing the same work while using fewer resources may not result in better quality either.
